# Hi, I'm Toby 👋

### 🙋 About me

I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at La Trobe University and proud to be working at Family Zone Cyber Safety.

I am always working on personal projects because working directly with new tools is the best way to learn them. I'm currently working on two large projects with a friend from uni - a social network for gamers and a studies tracker. I love connecting the dots, solving problems, improving workflows, etc.

Read my [gists](https://gist.github.com/tobyscott25). I use Arch btw. 😏

### 🔭 My personal hobbies and interests:
- Full stack web development
- Customising (*["ricing"](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn)*) Linux distributions (my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/tobyscott25/dotfiles)).

### ⭐ I have experience building and working with stacks using the following tools:
- Linux (primarily Debian-based distros)
- Git
- PHP (using [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/) for REST APIs)
- Python (Flask)
- MySQL (MariaDB)
- NodeJS
- ElectronJS
- Webpack
- VueJS (with [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/) state management)
- CSS Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Sass

### 🌱 Wanting to learn:
- TypeScript
- Mobile development (currently eyeing out [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/))
- Rust
- AWS / GCP
